DIA
===
	
The uml_dia module helps to develop new modules after an UML description using the DIA tool (http://www.gnome.org/projects/dia).

It's not a typical module in the sense that you don't have to install it on the server as another module. The contents of the module are just a python script for dia (codegen_openerp.py), a test dia diagram and the module generated by the test.

The module is located in the extra_addons branch: https://code.launchpad.net/openobject-addons

To use the module you need to make **codegen_openerp.py** accessible from dia, usually in your **/usr/share/dia/python** directory and make sure that it gets loaded once. To do it, just open dia and open a **Python Console** from the **Dialog Menu**, and type there "import codegen_openerp". If everything goes alright you will have a new option in your "Export..." dialog named "PyDia Code Generation (OpenERP)" that will create a zip module from your UML diagram.

To install win Dia in windows, first install Python-2.3.5, then when you install Dia, you will have an option to install the python plug-in. After this, put the codegen_openerp.py file in **C:\\Program Files\\Dia** and you will have the export function in Dia.

For further guidance to install Dia in Windows you can refer to this link	(http://openerpdev.blogspot.com/2009/11/rad-with-openerp.html)

If you find that the zip file is corrupt, use DiskInternals ZipRepair utility to repair the zip file before you'll be able to import it - make sure the zip file you import has the same name you saved as.

* Using the Expression button you can enter expressions in the Python language. These expressions can use all of the object's fields for their calculations. For example if you make a report on an order you can use the following expression:

.. code-block:: python

  '%.2f' % (amount_total * 0.9,)

.. *

In this example, amount_total is a field from the order object. The result will be 90% of the total of the order, formatted to two decimal places.

Add lang tag
------------
As OpenERP can be used in several languages, reports must be translatable.
But in a report, everything mustn't be translated: only the actual text and not the
formatting codes. A field will be processed by the translation system if the XML tag
which surrounds it (whatever it is) has a t="1" attribute. The server will translate all the
fields with such attributes in the report generation process.
It create the set Lang tag.
