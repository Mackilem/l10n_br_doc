Technical Memento
-----------------
A technical reference memento is available, to be used as a quick reference guide for
OpenERP developers, often nicknamed a "cheat sheet".

The memento is usually updated for each `major version <release_cycle>`_ of OpenERP,
and contains a global overview of OpenERP's Application Programming Interface,
including the declaration of modules, the ORM, the XML syntax, Dynamic views and Workflows.
The memento is not an extensive reference, but a way to quickly find out how
a certain OpenERP feature is accessed or used. Therefore each topic is only described
in a few words, usually with a small example.

The examples in the technical memento all come from the example module ``idea``, which
allows an organisation to manage the generic *ideas* submitted by its members.

There are 2 versions of the memento. One is suited for printing in A4 landscape mode,
with 3 columns of text per page, so that the whole memento is contained in less than 20
mini-pages (columns). The idea is to print and bind these pages as a reference booklet.
The second version contains some more details and is formatted in A4 portrait
mode, making it easier to read, but larger.

All versions of the technical memento (including previous ones) can be found at this
