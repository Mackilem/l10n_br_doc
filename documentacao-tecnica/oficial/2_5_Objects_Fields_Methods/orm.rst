The ORM - Object-relational mapping
===================================

The Models
----------

The ORM, short for Object-Relational Mapping, is a central part of OpenERP.

In OpenERP, the data model is described and manipulated through Python classes
and objects. It is the ORM job to bridge the gap -- as transparently as
possible for the developer -- between Python and the underlying relational
database (PostgreSQL), which will provide the persistence we need for our
objects.
