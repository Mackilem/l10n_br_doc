OpenERP Web v6.0
================

Introduction
============

**Web Client â€“ A software application that is launched via a web browser.**

With the launch of OpenERP v6, a new web client has been designed and developed, 
which provides a more professional appearance than OpenERP v5.

We migrated the web client to CherryPy3 dropping TurboGears completely
and migrated kid templates to faster Mako templates, a major step towards making
the Web Client much faster and easier to deploy.
	
All the Kid templates were converted to faster Mako templates, i18n/l18n features
have been partially reimplemented using Python Babel, CherryPy2 (TG is built on 
top of CP2) was replaced with CherryPy3, the latest, much better version of 
CherryPy Server.

This greatly reduces the pain of getting started with and deploying of OpenERP Web client.

Now the number of third party dependencies are reduced to 3-4 pure Python libraries which 
you can install within the local lib dir with the help of `populate.sh` script, found under 
the same lib directory.
	
-	Just get the source from Launchpad, run the **populate.sh** and launch the web client...

The initial test results are very impressive.

We have seen 3-5 times speed improvement.

Against OpenERP Web 5.0
=======================

Here are the benchmark results of the latest stable 6.0 version against the stable 5.0 branch which is running over TurboGears.

The benchmark test used Apache Benchmark Tool against larger Customer Invoice Form view.

Conclusion
==========
-	You can see significant performance boost in second test result. 
-	We observed 3-5 times speedup. 
-	There is still room to improve the performance further.
-	Like reducing RPC calls, catching results of some computationally heavy functions.
-	Implementing a way to directly call server methods if web client and server are installed on the same system (completely eliminating TCP layer).
