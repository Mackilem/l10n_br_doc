What are the planets ?
++++++++++++++++++++++

The planets are places where partners, developers and contributors express
their thoughts about the Open Object project. It's an aggregate of the personal blogs
of partners and contributors. We use them to announce new developments,
features and events on OpenERP and Open Object.

We have two planets:

* Open Object, the community planet : http://openobject.com/planet
* OpenERP, the editor planet : http://openerp.com/planet

Every OpenERP contributor can post blogs on the Open Object planet, if they
follow the writing guidelines. See the section below to subscribe.

Our marketing and editorial team will review the Open Object planet frequently.
When they notice good announcements, they will write an announcement and publish
on the OpenERP planet. If the new feature is very good, we may also write
a press release based on our article.


Writing Guidelines
++++++++++++++++++

To post on the Open Object planet, you must:

* Create a personal blog
* Subscribe your blog on the planet by sending an email to fp AT openerp.com
* Write blogs and attach the label "openobject" to your posts

Some rules to follow:

* All blog entries to be published in the planet must be in English
* Announce only new events, new features or new developments
* Promote the work you did primarily, not the company you represent
* Only write positive messages, not negatives ones
* Avoid commercial messages in the planet. The only acceptable commercial messages
  are from partners to announce training, exhibitions or
  conferences.

If you don't follow these rules, we may remove you from the planet.
