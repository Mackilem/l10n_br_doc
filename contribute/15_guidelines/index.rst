********************
 OpenERP Guidelines
********************

The following list of guidelines constitutes a key reference for everyone
involved in the OpenERP community. Every new contributor must
read it before starting the contribution process, in order to
maintain the high level of quality improvement in OpenERP.

It is also important for developers to periodically refresh their
skills and coding habits by having a quick read of these best-practices.

As part of the Quality Review Process, everyone is invited to refer
to these guidelines when providing feedback on contributions (code,
documentation, anything.). If a specific guideline seems to be missing
from the list, or if you have found a perfect example of a good (or bad)
pattern, please feel free to contribute.

The comments system can be used for this purpose, but it would be even
better to directly update the source of this documentation
(see the contribution guide).
