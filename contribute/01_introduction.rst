Introduction
------------

The Contribution Guide is intended as an overview and sometimes
even a reference on the organization of the OpenERP Community
and eco-system.
It serves as a quick start helper document for new members
of the OpenERP Community, but should prove quite useful to
more experienced members as well, as it is frequently
updated to follow the latest evolutions in the Community.

A few examples of the important topics you will find in the Contribution
Guide:

    * A description of the different Community tools in use ;
    * A description of the various Community actors and teams ;
    * An explanation of the current Community Processes ;
    * A set of incrementally written guidelines, dedicated to each
      major contribution area.

Of course this documentation is not frozen, and one of the first areas
everyone is invited to contribute to is the documentation itself!

In order to build the best enterprise management software ever created,
we need to foster a perfect collaboration between all OpenERP actors.
By joining the contributions and feedback from the Community, with
the market knowledge and experience of Partners and the quality control
and vision of the Publisher, we get the benefits of all worlds and
create a great product for the Customers. This is the recipe of
OpenERP's development and business model.

Launchpad, Community Platform
-----------------------------

We use `Launchpad.net <https://launchpad.net>`_, an open source project
management and collaboration platform, as our code hosting facility and
community platform.
All OpenERP-related projects are aggregated under the meta
`OpenObject <https://launchpad.net/openobject>`_ project group.

OpenERP more specifically uses the following Launchpad features, as further
detailed in this guide:

  * Bug Tracker : https://bugs.launchpad.net/openobject
  * Translations: https://translations.launchpad.net/openobject
  * Source version control and code Hosting: https://code.launchpad.net/openobject
  * Specifications/BluePrints : https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openobject
  * FAQ : https://answers.launchpad.net/openobject

Anyone in the OpenERP Community is free to use any of the above features.
The only requirement is to `sign up on Launchpad <https://login.launchpad.net/+new_account>`_ 
and join the `OpenERP Community <https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community/+join>`_ team,
which only requires a few clicks.

Some additional team memberships are required in order to accomplish specific
tasks, as explained in the corresponding sections of this Contribution Guide.
