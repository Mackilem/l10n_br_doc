Quality team are people from Tiny sprl responsible for the quality of the

responsibility.

Introduction
""""""""""""

To help developers and contributors make the right decisions when
improving OpenERP, we set up expert teams for different management domains.
Only people that have a strong experience in OpenERP and the related domain can
apply as an expert. We have teams of accountants, manufacturing experts,
technical experts, services management experts, ...

Developers can contact our experts mailing list when they need feedback on
particular features to be developed. Please contact our experts only for new
development related questions. They don't provide help on current features of
OpenERP. Most of our experts have very senior positions in the company they work
for, so they don't have time to spend providing help or support.

Requesting Advices to A Team
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When you `create a specification <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/openobject/+addspec>`_ 
for a new feature on launchpad (called a blueprint), you can
assign an expert team as a drafter of the specification. Then, you can click
on request feedback on your blueprint and assign this to an expert team.

They will receive a notification email and will discuss the requested
feature. The team will improve your specifications directly in your blueprint.
